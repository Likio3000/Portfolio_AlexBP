Hi there! I'm a data analyst based in Barcelona and I'm excited to share with you my three latest projects.

## Project 1: Supermarket Sales Analysis in Myanmar

In this project, I analyzed sales data from a supermarket chain in Myanmar to uncover trends and patterns in consumer behavior. By using data visualization techniques, I was able to identify which products were most popular and at what times they were purchased. Additionally, I examined the correlation between promotions and sales and provided recommendations for the supermarket chain to increase their revenue.

## Project 2: Analysis of Amazon Data

For my second project, I analyzed a large dataset from Amazon to extract insights and trends in consumer behavior. By using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques, I was able to identify factors that affect customer satisfaction and provided recommendations to Amazon to improve their customer experience.

## Project 3: Introduction to Machine Learning with BTC Data

In this project, I provided an introduction to machine learning using Bitcoin data. I explored the data, performed feature engineering, and trained a machine learning model to predict the price of Bitcoin. Additionally, I provided insights into how machine learning can be applied to finance and cryptocurrency.
