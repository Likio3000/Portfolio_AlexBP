# Portfolio Repository
Hello! I'm a data analyst based in Barcelona, and I'm thrilled to share my latest projects with you. Each one presents unique challenges and learning experiences. My passion for uncovering hidden trends and insights within data is a common thread throughout my work.

## Project 1: Sales Data Analysis
In this project, I delved into the world of sales data analysis. The main focus was to understand how sales were distributed among various categorical variables. Using data visualization techniques, I was able to identify trends and patterns that shed light on the best-performing product chains in terms of sales and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, I analyzed the most active sales hours, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics behind the sales patterns.

## Project 2: Forecasting with Regression and LSTM Models
My second project served as an introduction to forecasting using two different models: a regression model and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. This is an ongoing project that continually evolves as I deepen my knowledge in the field. So far, the regression model has been performing up to expectations, providing promising results. On the other hand, the LSTM model has presented challenges in learning from the data, providing me with an exciting opportunity to further improve and tweak the model.
